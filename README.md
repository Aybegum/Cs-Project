Comusicly is a desktop application designed to give the users a platform for both enjoying music and socializing  at the same time. With this app, the users can listen to their favorite artists and use different communities for different music genres and share posts and send messages in those different communities. Only a couple songs from the application was uploaded to gitHub since gitHub doesn’t allow uploading huge files and therefore, the nextSong method for playing a random song may not work properly as it does with all of the songs uploaded. 

Additionally, the reason why most of the commits were made from Beren’s computer was because the database was created and accessed locally from her computer.
